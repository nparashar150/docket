// Renders the app's real views into real, on-screen windows and prints where
// each one landed, so `scripts/capture-shots.sh` can photograph the screen
// region it occupies. Two kinds of image: every detail panel worth showing,
// and the shelf itself, which is the product.
//
// Why a window on a real display, rather than `ImageRenderer` or
// `cacheDisplay`: a panel's surface is `VisualEffectPlate(material: .popover,
// blending: .behindWindow)` and the shelf's is macOS 26 glass, and both are
// sampled by the window server from what is genuinely composited behind the
// window. Nothing is behind an offscreen bitmap, so an offscreen render comes
// back as a transparent - or, once flattened, black - slab with the text
// floating on it. The material is most of what these surfaces look like, so
// the only honest render is one the display has actually drawn.
//
// The images are documentation, and documentation that overstates the app is
// worse than none. Every view here is the shipping view, handed either live
// readings from this machine or its own `isPreview` sample data - the same
// values the widget library shows - and each shot says on its own line which
// of the two it is, so nothing downstream has to guess. Nothing is mocked up,
// and no number is typed in here to flatter a screenshot.

// MARK: - Protocol with the capture script
//
// One line per shot on stdout - `name x y width height source` - then a
// blocking read of stdin, which the script answers once `screencapture` has
// returned. A handshake rather than a sleep because a fixed wait is either too
// short on a busy machine or wasted on an idle one, and a truncated capture is
// silent.
