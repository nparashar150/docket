# Photographs the app's real detail panels, and the shelf itself, for the
# README.
#
# Builds the Shots target, which puts each view in a real window on a real
# display and prints where it landed; this script then screenshots that region.
# The round trip exists because these surfaces are behind-window materials -
# an NSVisualEffectView for a panel, macOS 26 glass for the shelf - and neither
# has anything to sample unless the window is genuinely on screen, so an
# offscreen render is not the same picture.
#
# Every capture is reported with what it actually shows: `live` for readings
# taken from this machine, this network or this clock, `sample` for a widget's
# own preview values, and `empty` for a panel's honest "nothing is connected"
# state. Anything that is not `live` has to be labelled wherever the image is
# used.
#
# Must be run on a Mac, sitting at a real display that is awake and unlocked.
# Screen Recording permission belongs to whatever runs this - Terminal, iTerm,
# your editor - not to the Shots binary, so the first run may capture blank
# images until that app is ticked in System Settings > Privacy & Security >
# Screen & System Audio Recording, and restarted.
#
# The run takes a few minutes: two panels wait on a network fetch, and one
# draws a live graph from a rolling one-second sampler, which is waited out
# rather than shipping a graph with four points in it. Everything sits above
# the rest of the display while it is captured, so leave the machine alone
# until it prints its summary.
