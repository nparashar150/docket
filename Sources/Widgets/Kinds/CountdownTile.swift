/// opening - and only while the countdown is idle, since a gesture that would
/// decline the click still swallows it. Restarting a countdown in flight
/// throws away time already run and is the panel's alone rather than a stray
/// click on a card.

/// The deadline lives in the widget's own config, so it survives a relaunch and
