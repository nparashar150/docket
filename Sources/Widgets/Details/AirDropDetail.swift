/// The one thing about AirDrop a glyph cannot say: whether anybody can
/// actually see this Mac.
///
/// The tile is a launcher and nothing more - it draws the same blue square
/// whether AirDrop is set to Everyone or switched off entirely, which is the
/// state where the tile is quietly a lie. So the panel reports the setting and
/// then gets out of the way with the two doors worth having: the Finder window
/// that lists nearby devices, and the settings pane where the mode is changed.
///
/// What is deliberately absent: nearby devices, transfer history, and a mode
/// picker. `sharingd` discovers peers over AWDL for its own UI and publishes
/// none of it to unprivileged apps, and `DiscoverableMode` is readable but not
/// ours to write - a toggle here would either do nothing or need a scripted
/// click on somebody else's window. The footnote says so plainly rather than
/// leaving the omission to look like an oversight.
///
/// The mode is read once, when the panel opens. It changes only when the user
/// goes and changes it - in Control Centre, in Finder, or in Settings - and
/// all three mean leaving this panel, which dismisses it. Polling for a value
/// that cannot move while it is on screen would be a timer spent on nothing.
