/// by the next - so this panel draws no tally, no goal ring and no week's
/// chart. Inventing any of them would be inventing the data behind them.
///
/// What it can say that the tile cannot: the clock time the next drink is due
/// at rather than a countdown to it, when the last one actually went in, the
/// interval those two are separated by, and - the tile's blind spot, since its
/// countdown floors at 0:00 - how long a drink has been overdue.
