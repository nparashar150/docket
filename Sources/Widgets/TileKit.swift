// The one structure every tile is built from, taken from Now Playing's:
//
//     [ badge ]  Value          [control]
//                caption
//
// Before this, each tile had its own: some led with a glyph, some with
// nothing, AirDrop with an app icon over a label, and values and captions ran
// at a different size on almost every card. Side by side on the shelf
// nothing lined up. Now the badge is the same square in the same place on
// every card, the value and caption are the same two type styles, and a
// control is always `TileGlyph`.

/// The square a tile leads with: the widget's live mark on a pane of glass.
///
/// The same size as Now Playing's artwork, so a row of tiles has one left
/// edge for its pictures and one for its text. Neutral, like the card: what
/// is drawn in it carries the meaning, and any colour in it is an accent.
